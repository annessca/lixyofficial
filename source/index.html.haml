        %p We are here to help you execute on your vision.

        %p.text-center
          Competitive advantages are created by identifying untapped markets and incorporating
          them into your plan. Africa is not a well-known source for technology, and that is an
          opportunity. LIXY identifies, trains, and manages top-quality engineers, allowing you
          to benefit from dramatically reduced costs and time in finding the right engineers,
          while still maintaining your high expectations for quality.
        %p.text-center
          We augment your team with experienced high-quality engineers, at a fraction of what
          you would pay for even a fresh graduate in the local market. We take care of the
          hassle of hiring, provide continuing education, and ensure high performance, so you
          can focus on building the product you need.

          Quality Matters

        -#%p.text-center
          Quality code matters to us and it should matter to you. Not only will your code be built to meet your current needs, it will be built to facilitate future needs.
          This is significant when you want to add new features, cross platforms, or make updates down the road.
          This is also one of the major differences between good code and bad code.
          All of our software solutions deliver functions and features that are built on-spec, as well as scalable, reliable, and robust.
