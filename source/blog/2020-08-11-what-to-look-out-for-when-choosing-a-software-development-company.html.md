## A guide to outsourcing your software development

Now that you know you need to [outsource your product development], selecting the right and compatible software development company to [partner] with can be tricky. Considering the number of organizations that claim they are capable of delivering scalable software but fail to deliver on their promises, there are several non-negotiable features that you need to look out for when searching for the right partner for the development of your software

In this article, we would be taking a look at some of them. Before we dive into the features to look out for, what exactly are software development companies? They are third party organizations that are in the business of designing and building applications for individuals or organizations that require the automation of their daily activities to increase productivity.

One of the most important reasons organizations outsource software development is to focus on their business while they transform digitally. [Statistics also show that more processes are getting automated yearly], which means there is already an increase in the need for software development companies.

Let us take a look at 11 of the most important things to look out for

### 1. Size

One of the essential features to check is the size of your partner's organization. Choosing the size of your development partner is a golden rule in software development outsourcing.

This can be done by looking into their portfolio to see if they typically service companies your size. However, a portfolio packed with products similar to yours does not automatically guarantee the success of your project if there is a huge size discrepancy between the software development company and your organization.

Larger software development firms have several processes, marketing channels, and clients than relatively smaller ones and may not pay the right attention your project deserves. In the same vein, too small companies may find it difficult to handle your project.

### 2. Rates
Getting rates from a couple of organizations can help you figure out the standard rates in the market and help you figure out how each additional service adds to the overall cost. It is possible to identify significant price changes from many offers, but don't focus exclusively on the price.

Higher rates or lower rates don't always show the level of service to be delivered. That is why at LIXYTECH, we give you unbeatable prices and still guarantee world-class services. Our [case study] typically proves that.

### 3. Communication

The communication skills of the organization you are looking at outsourcing your software development is one of the most important things to consider as it can directly affect the product's success. First of all, they must be able to speak your language fluently; then they must have good communication habits.

The best development firms can communicate with the product owners using tools like [Slack] and [Google Meet] and report the status of different tasks using tools like [Focus booster] during the product development process. A straightforward way to figure this out before signing a contract with any organization is their response to emails or queries before the start of development. That should give you an idea of some of the habits they have in-house.

### 4. Access to resources

The best software development firms have access to a broader range of technological tools, as well as technical talent. They provide you with a variety of tools and the talent capable of using them to achieve the best results.

The tools and engineers assigned to your product depends on your needs and specification of your product. The best development firms have [access to the top 1% of tech experts] across the world.

### 5. Testimonials

Always check for testimonials before engaging a software development team. The testimony helps you recognize the kind of organizations they have been working with. The stories that the organizations tell can go a long way in showing you the kind of services you should expect from them.

Look for quotes and see for yourself first hand what other people have to say about the software organization and their services.


### 6. Their expertise

Searching for the ideal software development firm can be a bit tedious, but you need to diligently look for a team that specializes in the same field as your project. Luckily, you might find an organization that has built a similar product to yours.

This isn't always possible, but it might make things easier. To identify companies that have done something similar to your project, all you need to do is to check their portfolio on the internet or precisely check their website. The portfolio of some organizations is usually stated under the 'Services' section on the software firm's website.


### 7. Comprehensive service

An ideal development firm would have all the necessary tools and talent needed for the development of your product, but their services should not end there.

 Additional services, including advisory, content creation, maintenance, and more, should be provided as complimentary services to contribute to the overall success of your product.
This arrangement may only last till the completion of the agreed project, but these services help put you on the right track.

### 8. Formal Agreement

Hesitating towards sending a brief to an organization in a different state or country is quite understandable. You definitely want to ensure both your Intellectual Property and finances are not getting into the wrong hands. The great news is there is no need to worry.

**Most software organizations offer NDAs (Non-Disclosure Agreements** and contracts that prevent them from revealing confidential information to third parties and also protect you from being defrauded. Trustworthy companies will sign the contract with zero hesitation. Avoid companies that hesitate to sign the contract.

### 9. Avoid firms that say yes everything

As counter-intuitive as this sounds, yes-sayers might become problematic. Look for a group of experts that know their job so well they know when to say no.

The ability to question some of your requirements and design selection is a sign of skilled expertise. A requirement to ensure you get the best quality for the development of your project. After all, you are searching for experts in their field – someone who will adequately guide you through the development process.

### 10. Background of the firm

Always pay attention to the background of the team or organization you are looking to work with as you would need to know the people you are entrusting your project to. Before you go ahead and decide to partner with a software firm that looks excellent on paper, get some time to make a video call and maybe ask to speak with the team that would be assigned to the development of your project.

That way, you can rest assured that you are not giving your project to abstract people. During the call, you can ask questions about the experience of the team and other questions you might have.
