Hiring software engineers is a complex and challenging process. You must find the right places to advertise, create a clear job description, screen many applicants to select the right candidates, interview them to find those that will fit your team, and finally assess them to ensure they have the skills you need.

It can be a tedious, time-consuming process, and can distract you from building your business. Even worse, making the wrong hire can hurt your team's morale and productivity. Getting it right can only be achieved through long experience in identifying quality tech talent that can deliver highly scalable products. 

While you can learn the art of identifying high-performance people through expensive trial and error, it often makes more sense to take advantage of those that have already built this skill through years of recruiting experience.

Here are 7 of the most important benefits to outsourcing your technical recruiting:

#### 1. Higher quality tech talent
The people are the most valuable asset any organization can acquire; this is why it is so important to find the "right" ones for your team. Having anything less than an efficient and high-quality recruitment process is gambling with the future of your company. Recruitment firms specialize in identifying the best talent in the tech space. Quality recruitment firms will handle the entire process of finding skilled engineers, allowing you to choose from only the best.

#### 2. Reduced time to hire
Filling tech roles can be a long, time-consuming process: searching for candidates, interviewing them, assessing their skill level all take time. Even at experienced organizations, this can take months. However, quality recruitment firms usually need only a few weeks to find the right people, as they know where to look and how to attract the best talent. Top firms have a deep pool of candidates they have already evaluated and can reach out to for even faster results. Our recruiting experts ensure the minimum time required to deliver quality candidates to you.

#### 3. Cost reduction
The process of finding and hiring the best tech talent can be costly, especially when you do not have the experience needed to attract the best talent. Even when you know the skills you are looking for, finding people with those skills can be frustrating when you discover how much effort it takes to connect with those people, let alone hire them.

The hiring process for many organizations usually involves placing job postings on different platforms to get the attention of the general public and hoping that the right talent gets to see it. Recruitment firms know the best platforms to advertise, but they go far beyond just this. They already have a database of a pool of pre-qualified tech talent, are continually networking and hosting events to find active, as well as passive candidates. They take on the entire cost of getting applicants in the door, and have many more channels to find talent. You do not pay anything until you have found the right person, and they start working.

#### 4. Focus on your business
The process of hiring engineers is both time-consuming and distracting. The last thing you want is to spend your time and energy on lower value elements of your business. Outsourcing your tech recruitment allows you to focus on the core of your business while getting access to the best talent in the market. Recruiting to fill tech roles should not be the reason you lose focus on pushing your business to the next level.

#### 5. Strong analytics and reporting
The best tech recruitment firms don't just present a list of candidates from their pool of talent. These organizations usually have robust data to back how candidates are selected. Recruitment firms understand that a wrong hire can derail the growth of an organization. They carefully document the recruitment process; they strictly follow the rules and guidelines to ensure quality results eliminating nepotism and other forms of favoritism that affect the quality of hiring. Going with the right recruitment firm means you can rest assured that the tech talent you are hiring is the best fit for your organization.

#### 6. Competitive advantage
Top companies know they do not have what it takes to hire the right tech talent while focusing on the core of their business, so they take advantage of recruitment firms to get the job done. When you outsource your tech recruitment to industry experts, it allows you to stay ahead of your competitors by having access to some of the most skilled talent in the market, many of whom are not actively looking on job boards.

#### 7. Rapid growth
When you hire right, you are setting your company up for success. Outsourcing your tech recruitment to a reliable and trusted recruiting firm is the first step to ensuring the growth of your organization. When you need to add a large number of engineers to your team quickly, it can be extremely time-consuming to do so in-house. Since recruiting firms are always in hiring-mode, they have a large number of candidates they are working with at any given time. Many top-quality candidates go to them first, knowing the recruiter can quickly help them find a good job. Recruiters also have a list of highly skilled engineers that are not actively looking, but would be open to moving for the "right" opportunity. All of this allows recruiting firms to present many top-quality candidates for you to choose from.

Hiring a recruitment firm to handle your hiring lets you focus on the core of your business, and it assures you of a higher chance of hiring right.
